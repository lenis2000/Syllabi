How do we know a mathematical claim is true?
In this course, we
will explore the nature of mathematical proof through an
interactive, collaborative approach
by building, testing, and refining mathematical arguments from first principles.
Rather than memorizing
established results, we will distinguish among examples,
counterexamples, conjectures, and formal proofs, learning to
recognize both the power and limitations of empirical
evidence in mathematics.

Through problem-solving sessions and “math battles,”
students will practice evaluating the success or failure of
proofs, sharpen their ability to communicate abstract ideas,
and rigorously challenge one another’s claims. By
experiencing mathematics as a creative process --- where logical
structure and empirical observations combine to form
reliable conclusions --- students will cultivate a deeper
awareness of how and why certain arguments achieve
certainty.  Along the way, we will experience mathematics as a creative, empirical discipline where
logical reasoning transforms intuition into certainty.

This course will allow you to 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Define and delimit what constitutes valid mathematical evidence} by distinguishing between examples, counterexamples, conjectures, and formal proofs, while recognizing the limitations of empirical observations.\\
    % \emph{(Aligned with pillar objective: “define and delimit what constitutes empirical evidence”)}

    \item \textbf{Develop a framework for discerning different types of mathematical knowledge} by exploring how empirical evidence, abstract reasoning, and logical structure work together to shape mathematical understanding.\\
    % \emph{(Aligned with pillar objective: “develop a framework for discerning types of knowledge based on what is empirically
observable in the natural, physical and social worlds”)}

    \item \textbf{Formulate and communicate mathematical reasoning} by translating intuitive insights into precise statements, evaluating the soundness of arguments, and engaging in constructive dialogue to identify and resolve reasoning gaps.\\
    % \emph{(Aligned with pillar objective: “evaluate supported claims about the natural and social worlds by framing empirical questions and methods and interpreting the claims in the context of new data”)}

    \item \textbf{Reflect on the nature of mathematical truth} by examining personal assumptions about certainty, analyzing when and why certain arguments are conclusive, and articulating how purely empirical approaches can both inform and limit our understanding of complex phenomena.\\
    % \emph{(Aligned with pillar objective: “articulate the limitations of using only empirical approaches to describe complex phenomena”)}
\end{enumerate}
