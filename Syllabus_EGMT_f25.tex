\section{How do we know a claim is true?}

This course is a hands-on workshop in making and testing arguments in the context of mathematics.
We will generate conjectures from examples, search for counterexamples, and turn ideas into precise statements and proofs. Through problem-solving sessions and math debates, you'll practice evaluating arguments, giving and receiving constructive feedback, and communicating clearly in writing and speech. By experiencing mathematics as a creative process --- where patterns suggest conjectures and logical reasoning turns intuition into conviction --- you'll develop a practical sense for what counts as evidence in mathematics and how to build reliable conclusions.
By the end of the course, you will be able to
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Define and delimit what constitutes valid mathematical evidence} by distinguishing between examples, counterexamples, conjectures, and formal proofs, while recognizing the limitations of empirical observations.
    % \emph{(Aligned with pillar objective: “define and delimit what constitutes empirical evidence”)}
    \item \textbf{Develop a framework for discerning different types of mathematical knowledge} by exploring how empirical evidence, abstract reasoning, and logical structure work together to shape mathematical understanding.
    % \emph{(Aligned with pillar objective: “develop a framework for discerning types of knowledge based on what is empirically
% observable in the natural, physical and social worlds”)}
    \item \textbf{Formulate and communicate mathematical reasoning} by translating intuitive insights into precise statements, evaluating the soundness of arguments, and engaging in constructive dialogue to identify and resolve reasoning gaps.
    % \emph{(Aligned with pillar objective: “evaluate supported claims about the natural and social worlds by framing empirical questions and methods and interpreting the claims in the context of new data”)}
    \item \textbf{Reflect on the nature of mathematical truth} by examining personal assumptions about certainty, analyzing when and why certain arguments are conclusive, and articulating how purely empirical approaches can both inform and limit our understanding of complex phenomena.
    % \emph{(Aligned with pillar objective: “articulate the limitations of using only empirical approaches to describe complex phenomena”)}
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
\textbf{Math debate split session:} One additional session of math debates in the weeks of September 15 and 22. 
Class split in half by poll (others welcome to attend the debate, too).

\section{How we work together}

This is a hands-on, pen-and-paper course. Each meeting begins with 
brief review, then you receive
a fresh problem set. You work at your table in fixed small groups, develop ideas, test them, and revise when needed. I circulate, ask questions, and may invite nearby peers to listen in and challenge your reasoning.

\begin{enumerate}[$\bullet$]
  \item \textbf{Home subgroups (fixed):} On day one we form 6 ``home subgroups'' for in-class collaboration:
  $\delta, \ \theta, \ \zeta, \ \sigma, \ \lambda, \ \phi$.\footnote{Math and science use Greek symbols very often. The names of the subgroups are 
	\emph{delta}, \emph{theta}, \emph{zeta}, \emph{sigma}, \emph{lambda}, and \emph{phi}.}
	Groups remain stable.


	\item \textbf{In-class problem work (at the table):} At
	the start of class you receive a new problem set.
	Your group works at the table; when ready, you explain
	your solution to me, who plays a role of a skeptical audience.
	You may use scrap paper or your commonplace book to write up your solution.
	During your subgroup's explanation, I may ask a different member to continue the explanation,
	so everyone should understand the full argument.

  \item \textbf{Random mixers:} 
		For some time at the end of the class, we work 
		in randomly mixed groups.
		Quick reshuffles outside your home group will allow you
		to compare partial solutions and share techniques.
		
	 \item \textbf{Debate session (dedicated slot with a new
	 problem):} In a scheduled debate block (separate from
	 regular weekly work), the class receives a \emph{new}
	 problem designed for argument-testing. There is
	 structured \emph{work time} to develop approaches,
	 followed by \emph{presentation and questioning}. I will
	 select the presenter (or pair) for the claim; all other
	 groups focus on finding holes: sharpening definitions,
	 proposing counterexamples, and locating gaps. Roles
	 rotate across debates so everyone experiences proposing,
	 questioning, and summarizing.

  \item \textbf{Commonplace book:} Bring it every time.
	Use it for quick recaps, sketches, diagrams, partial
	proofs, and brief reflections which are submitted
	to Canvas each week (see details below).

  \item \textbf{Team roles (rotate each meeting):} In groups of $5$--$6$, 
		the following sample roles work well:
		\begin{compactitem}
			\item \textsc{Explainer}: articulates the current
			approach and restates the problem in your own words.
			\item \textsc{Skeptic}: presses on assumptions, looks
			for gaps, and frames precise questions.
			\item \textsc{Counterexample Hunter}: designs and
			tests examples/edge cases to probe the claim.
			\item \textsc{Recorder}: maintains a clean write-up in
			the commonplace book.
			\item \textsc{Verifier}: checks computations and logic, and
			ensures steps follow from the stated problem.
			\item \textsc{Connector}: ensures that all subgroup
			members understand and can explain the solution.
		\end{compactitem}
		You may keep the roles informal or explicitly assign them in your
		subgroup, but \emph{make sure you rotate them each week}.

  \item \textbf{Devices:} Please keep devices in your bag 
		unless you have an accommodation that requires otherwise
		(think: studio or lab norms). This is a pen-and-paper course.
\end{enumerate}



















% we work on problem sets
%
% these problem sets are not requiring any math knowledge beyond middle school, but go in a different direction that many student might not be familiar with (if you have a background, make sure to not put more than one such person in a group)
%
% you see a new problem set when coming to class
%
% during class you discuss with the group the problems and the group presents them orally when ready
%
% I try to find counterexamples and be competitive about your solution (be ready to defend your solution)
%
% when in presentation, I can ask another subgroup member to continue the presentation at any moment, so before presenting, make sure that all group members undertand all the details of the solution
%
% we will also have mixers during each class for shared experience and to get to know each other better
%
%
% also, starting from second class, we will have mini-debates: one person presents a problem, other subgroups work on counterexamples and finding holes in the argument, or asking questions
%
%
%
%
% this is a pen and paper course, no devices are allowed during class
%
%
% common place book is good for taking notes, but scrap ppaer will also be available.
%
% we sometimes will use manipulatives
%
%
% \begin{enumerate}[$\bullet$]
%   \item \textbf{Subgroups:} At the first meeting, we form 6 fixed ``home subgroups''
%   for collaboration during class meetings.
%
%   Subgroups are
%   $\delta, \ \theta, \ \zeta, \ \sigma, \ \lambda, \ \phi$
%
%   for trust, momentum, and shared notation. Most meetings include a 10-minute \emph{random mixer} to cross-pollinate ideas.
%   \item \textbf{Debates:} Frequent \emph{mini-debates}, one \emph{Big Debate Meeting}
%   \item \textbf{norm:} Keep devices in your bag during activities (think: yoga studio / lab). Accessibility accommodations always honored.
%
%   \item \textbf{Commonplace book:} Your paper notebook for pre-class recaps, in-class sketches, diagrams, drafts, and reflections.
