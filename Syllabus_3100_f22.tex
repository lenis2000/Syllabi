\section{A mathematical study of randomness}

How random is everything around us, and what chance do we have of understanding it? What to do when you're not certain, and how to do it right? How many falling stars will you see as you walk outside one beautiful night? 

Probability theory is a mathematical study of uncertainty. It is a rigorous foundation of statistics --- and many areas of human knowledge operate in a language of statistics nowadays (yes, and robots use it, too!). The course introduces fundamental concepts, ideas, and techniques of probability theory. It will provide you with the foundational mathematical knowledge needed to address the questions above and will help you develop intuition about randomness.

\subsection*{What you will get from this course}

\begin{enumerate}[\bf{}1.]
	\item Mastery of basic probability concepts:
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
		\item What is a probability space and how to translate commonly-sounding problems into this language;
		\item How to count (in an advanced way) to compute probabilities;
		\item What is a random variable, a probability distribution,
		and what are their main quantitative properties;
		\item 
		How commonly encountered probability 
		distributions (binomial, Poisson, exponential, Gaussian) look like and behave,
		what are 
		their properties, and in which situations they typically arise.
	\end{enumerate}

	\item How large random systems behave, and what the 
	bell-shaped curve
	\raisebox{-8pt}{\begin{tikzpicture}
		[scale=.7]
		\draw[ultra thick, domain=-.9:.9] plot[samples=300] ({\x}, {2.7128^(-10*\x*\x)});
		\draw[->, thick] (-1.01,0)--(1.05,0);
		\draw[->, thick] (0,-.1)--(0,1.25);
	\end{tikzpicture}}
	has to do with this.
	\item How to describe and quantify the mutual dependence of random events,
	and how to use such a description 
	to infer properties of ``hidden'' random events.
	\item How to apply probability theory to model real-life processes. For example,
		how to use Bayes theorem to understand various medical tests.
	\item How to collaborate on solving probability problems in pairs, small groups, and online,
	and present solutions clearly and efficiently.
	% \item How to design probability problems (for example, for the
	% final exam), and evaluate problems presented by others.
	\item In what ways probability theory is connected to science,
	engineering, and other branches of knowledge.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Prerequisite} You should have taken at least one semester of calculus (MATH 1320 level):
mathematical study of random variables often requires single and double integrals
and infinite series.

\subsection*{What this course is and what it is not}

This course in probability \emph{theory} belongs to pure mathematics, with
rigorous definitions, calculations, and proofs. However, the objects which we
study are motivated by real-life applications, and so pure mathematical
arguments often appeal to our common sense understanding of these objects.
There will be opportunities to explore (and discover new) connections of the
theory studied in the course with the real world.

Also, this course does not thoroughly discuss \emph{applications to statistics}.
Probability
theory focuses on developing the mathematical side, and statistics applies
these mathematical theories to real data (coming from observations). In this
course we will not discuss how to analyze data coming from observations ---
there are courses in statistics for that.

\subsection{About the instructor}
I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Mathematics at UVA, and I've
been here since 2014. My research area is probability theory (very appropriate
for this course!). More precisely, I am using exact formulas to study large
random systems. I also like computer simulations of random systems like 
\href{https://d3m0khvr0ybm92.cloudfront.net/img/blog/heart/UVA_colors_small.png}{\texttt{this one}}.
I'm happy to tell you more if you're

\section{Assessing your learning}

Learning mathematics means \emph{doing} mathematics: during class meetings, on your own, and in groups.
In this course, doing mathematics mainly amounts to solving problems.
The following aspects are assessed in this course:

\subsection{Course engagement (25\%)}

I am putting a lot of emphasis
into the various engagement components which ask you to interact with 
your peers (and the instructor) while learning the material. This includes:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{In-class participation}. 
		Being present and involved in discussions at most of the in-class meetings
		is essential to getting a hands-on experience 
		in problem solving. 
		I understand that many people cannot participate in all class meetings due to various
		circumstances. 
		I expect to give full credit for class participation 
		if you come to at least 75\% of the class meetings (not counting midterms).
	\item \textbf{Quizzes}. 
		The quizzes are based on the material similar to the previous homework.
		Lowest $2$ quiz grades our of 12 total quizzes are dropped.
		See the course schedule (\Cref{sub:schedule}) for quiz dates.
	\item \textbf{Office hours}. Come to office hours (if needed, 
		sing up for appointments, see \Cref{sub:meeting_times}) 
		with questions about the material.
		I am always happy to discuss your ideas and explain math.
		As a rule, I expect every student to come to office hours or schedule a one on one appointment
		at least once throughout the semester.
\end{itemize}

I expect that most people who are paying attention to the class,
come to meetings, and interact with peers, will get close to full credit for
the course engagement.

\subsection{Problem sets (20\%)}

\begin{enumerate}[$\bullet$]
	\item Weekly problem sets consist of textbook and other problems aligned with 
		lectures and 
		in-class discussions, to
		help you practice new concepts and techniques. 
		The written solutions are typically due on
		Tuesdays at 10pm, and sometimes on Thursdays (see the schedule in \Cref{sub:schedule}).
		Problem sets are posted to Collab assignments
		about one week in advance.
	\item You are encouraged to work together on problem sets.
		Group work allows to 
		take advantage of challenge-defend discussions which help understand things
		better.
		However, each student needs to submit her/his own written work, 
		and should write this up individually. 
		This helps better retain the material and prepare for tests.
	\item 
		When solving homework problems, use your math and common sense understanding to check for your own mistakes,
		see \Cref{sub:problem_solving} for details.
	\item 
		The work \emph{must be submitted only on Collab} --- 
		take pictures or scan your work,
		make sure it's readable,
		put it into a \emph{single PDF file with correct orientation},
		and upload it to the Collab assignments before the deadline.
		Failure to make a single PDF might result in zero points for a work
		(first, a warning will be given).
\end{enumerate}

The homeworks are graded \emph{for participation only}.
That is, I will typically not read all of your 
work, but will look for typical mistakes to address
in class. 
In your solution submitted to Collab
you need to attempt most of the problems --- otherwise, credit for the homework might
not be given (there is no partial credit for a single homework). However, it is rare that a 
homework will not be accepted for credit.

To get full 10\% for the homework grades, 
you need to submit 10 solutions (for which I give credit)
out of 12 total problem sets.


\subsection{Midterm tests (2 tests each worth 15\%; 30\% in total)}

There are two midterm tests
held
during regular class times, on \textbf{September 27} and \textbf{October 27}.
They have
similar taste as homework and quizzes, and test basic knowledge of the material.

\textbf{``Cheat sheet''}.
A two-sided letter size formula sheet, hand-written by yourself, is
allowed on each midterm test and on the final exam. Preparing this formula sheet
will help you review the material, and paint a systematic picture of the material in your mind.
In general, formula sheets cannot contain any photocopied or
printed material --- do everything by hand (of course, you can
include any theorems, formulas, pictures, examples, etc).
One exclusion: if you write the formula sheet out on a
tablet and print, this is allowed, if helps --- but don't copy
formula sheets from other people.

I encourage you to collaborate on preparing for the tests, but needless to say that
during the test and the final exam each student must work individually.

When solving midterm problems, use your math and common sense understanding to check for your own mistakes,
see \Cref{sub:problem_solving} for details.


\subsection{Final exam (25\%)}

The final exam will be cumulative, but will put more focus 
on topics covered after the second midterm.
Formula sheet is also allowed, same as for midterms.

On the final exam, use your math and common sense understanding to check for your own mistakes,
see \Cref{sub:problem_solving} for details.


\subsection*{Letter grades}

The scale by which course percent grades are turned into course letter grades
will most likely be the following:
\begin{equation*}
	\begin{tabular}{l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|}
		Grade      & $ A+	$ & $A	$ & $A-	$ & $B+	$ & $B	$ & $B-	$ & $C+	$ & $C	$ & $C-	$ & $D+	$ & $D	$ & $D-$ \\
		\hline
		Minimum \% & 100     & 93   & 89    & 86    & 82    & 79    & 76    & 72    & 69    & 66    & 62    & 59
	\end{tabular}
\end{equation*}
I reserve the right to slightly change this grade scale after the
final exam.
This may be needed
to better incorporate into the letter grade
possible fluctuations in the difficulty level of 
midterms and the final.

\section{How to succeed in the course}
\label{success}

If you have read the long syllabus through here, you are on the right
track to succeed!

\subsection{General things}

The best way to learn in the course is to 
come to all classes, read the textbook,
and do all the homework problems on your own or in collaboration.
This will prepare you well for quizzes and tests.

\subsection{Main textbook}

The textbook \emph{Introduction to Probability} by Anderson, Sepp\"al\"ainen, and Valk\'o 
is 
an excellent resource 
to gain understanding of the course material. Some notes about it:

\begin{enumerate}[$\bullet$]
	\item I strongly encourage you to read the textbook in parallel with 
		the lectures, as lectures are largely based on the textbook.
		The textbook includes many examples and
		extra exercises which augment the concepts discussed in class.
	\item The textbook contains much more material than will be covered in classes, so it
		makes sense to come to classes to note which parts are omitted
		(and so won't be in tests and quizzes).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Additional textbooks}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item 
		\emph{``Probability'' by Jim Pitman} is a reasonable alternative textbook.
	\item 
		\emph{Free textbook} 
		\emph{``Introduction to Probability'' by Grinstead and Snell}.
			Download: \url{https://math.dartmouth.edu/~prob/prob/prob.pdf};
			Accompanying web page: \url{https://www.dartmouth.edu/~chance/teaching_aids/books_articles/probability_book/book.html}.
\end{enumerate}

These textbooks contain additional problems and material.
They may be helpful if you want a deeper understanding of
some concepts, or if you want to read an exposition of the
familial material in a different style, which might be very
helpful for better learning.

(It absolutely not required that you buy or read these books.)

\subsection{Problem solving and self-checking}
\label{sub:problem_solving}

Solving problems, one can easily make arithmetic mistakes,
and this is understandable. However, 
we are doing probability theory, so some answers to problems
may be easily dismissed as wrong
based on common sense. 
The most obvious examples are 
getting a \emph{negative probability}; \emph{probability strictly greater than 1};
getting a \emph{negative variance}; and so on.
It is expected that you use this type of common sense to filter out 
obviously wrong answers.
Solid partial credit will be given even in the case when you get an obviously
wrong answer, and note near it:
\begin{quote}
	``Well, this answer is clearly incorrect because $\{\textnormal{expanation}\}$''.
\end{quote}
Obviously wrong answers without such a note 
will result in much less partial credit for the whole problem.

\subsection{Extra reading}

The popular book
\emph{``How Not to Be Wrong: The Power of Mathematical Thinking'' by Jordan Ellenberg}
discusses how math touches every aspect of real life, and has 
numerous examples related to probability and statistics. 
I can recommend this nice book as a parallel reading. Some
examples I learned from this book might be mentioned in class.
(It absolutely not required that you buy or read this book.)

\subsection{Office hours}

I am available during office hours to answer questions on the content of the 
course, clarify various points, and I can also help you with homework assignments. 
Besides regular office hours, you can schedule appointments online, see 
\Cref{sec:necc}.

\subsection{Math Collaborative Learning Center}

The Math Department 
Collaborative Learning Center
is available for helping students in this course: 
see \url{https://math.virginia.edu/undergraduate/MCLC/}
for more information and schedule. 
(Usually it takes a week or so after the semester starts for MCLC to start working.)

\subsection{Other resources}

There is a number of online resources which may help you while doing the homework:
Khan Academy, Wikipedia, and many other 
places contain lots of basic material on probability theory. Google Search
in general
is also a valuable resource.

\subsection{Collaboration on homework assignments}
\label{collaboration}

Group work on homework problems is allowed and strongly encouraged.
Discussions are in general very
helpful and inspiring. Class meetings will also contain ample time
for group work on homework problems.
Nevertheless, before talking to others, get well started
on the problems, and contribute your fair share to the process. 

When completing the written homework assignments, everyone must write up his or her own
solutions in their own words, and cite any reference 
(other than the textbook and
class notes) that you use. Quotations and citations are part of the Honor Code for both UVa
and the whole academic community. 

It is very important that you truly understand the homework solutions you hand
in, otherwise you may be unpleasantly surprised by your quiz and test results.

\section{Policies}

\subsection{Late/make up work} Each homework
assignment will have due date and time by which it must be submitted to collab.
After the 1-hour grace period, late assignments are not accepted.
There will also be no make up for the quizzes or midterm tests.
However, if you have special needs, emergency, or unavoidable conflicts, please
let me know as soon as possible, so we can arrange a workaround for midterms and the final exam.

\subsection{Special needs}

All students with special needs requiring accommodations should present the
appropriate paperwork from the Student Disability Access Center (SDAC). It is
the student's responsibility to present this paperwork in a timely fashion and
follow up with the instructor about the accommodations being offered.
Accommodations for midterms or final exams (e.g., extended time) should be arranged at
least 5 days before an exam.

\subsection{Honor Code} The University of Virginia Honor Code applies to this
class and is taken seriously (in particular, 
see \Cref{collaboration} on homework collaboration).
Any honor code violations,
especially in written tests (midterms and the final exam)
will be referred to the
Honor Committee.

\subsection{Collab anonymous feedback}
If you have anonymous comments on anything related to the course, you can make
them via Collab.
